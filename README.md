# 5000cats

Project for the Udacity course: JavaScript and Design Patterns. 
It's actually called "Premium Cat-Clicker" project, but our goal was to create a game that would allow infinite cats to be clicked off of a list. 
We needed to add functionality to the list in order to display the correct cat when the list items are clicked. 
The code is written in Vanilla because it is a project done before learning to use libraries.
